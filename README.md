# Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Chronic Disease Management Using a Markov Model

## RPubs Publication
An interactive, rendered version of this project, including the R code, outputs, and visualizations, is available on RPubs: (https://rpubs.com/amany33/1307981)

## Visualizations

- **Cost-Effectiveness Plane**:
  ![Cost-Effectiveness Plane](outputs/ce_plane.png)
  The intervention (red) is less costly and more effective than standard care (blue), dominating it.

- **PSA Scatter Plot**:
  ![PSA Plot](outputs/psa_plot.png)
  Most points are in the bottom-right quadrant, confirming the interventionâ€™s dominance in 95% of iterations at $0/QALY and 98% at $50,000/QALY.

  ## How to Replicate
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmanyMarey2/Chronic-Disease-CEA-Markov-Model.git
   cd Chronic-Disease-CEA-Markov-Model
